## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the server.<br />
The server will reload if you make edits because of Nodemon.<br />

### `flow`

Runs flow on the server. For each time you make edits you may have to stop the server using
`flow stop`, and run `flow` again. <br />

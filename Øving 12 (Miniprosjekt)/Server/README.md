## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

For installing the node_modules folder.<br />
You will have to have this folder for running the program. Github doesn't allow for such large folders, so just run this after you have cloned the application. <br />

### `npm start`

Starts the server.<br />
The server will reload if you make edits because of Nodemon.<br />

### `flow`

Runs flow on the server. For each time you make edits you may have to stop the server using
`flow stop`, and run `flow` again. <br />

---

Important notice! Make sure to be in the right directory in your terminal by using:
`cd server` for reaching this folder from the root folder or `cd ..` to go back one step
